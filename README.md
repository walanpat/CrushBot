# CrushBot
Crush-bot will be a fully fledged multipurpose bot designed for various table-top/card game based hobbies.

Right now crush bot has a
* Dice rolling implementation (needs refactoring)
* MTG card searching and card querying tool based on scryfalls database/query system.

What will be implemented:
* YouTube interactions
* Special rolls based on DnD 5e useful for GM's (crit success table, crit fail table, travel rolls, etc.)
* A way to roll a 5e character stats and automatically drop the lowest of all the numbers.
* And more to be determined!  

The goal is for this to be a super helpful hobby bot,
Eventually the bot will have all of its code ported to a mobile app for MTG card querying since many of the apps are not very good or poorly maintained.

If you everything on the market sucks might as well make your own right?
