Querying cards can be done multiple ways:

color:r g rg,
This is red or green or Red-AND-Green.

cmc:>=3,
This is converted mana greater than or equal to 3

type:instant,goblin,
All card types are insant AND goblin

power:>=4,
Here you can use greater than,less than,equal to what ever power

toughness:>=4,
Same thing as the rules for querying power but with toughness

text:Enters the battle field tapped,
Here you can query for specific keywords or phrases in the cards text

rarity:r,
rarity is listed as:mr,m,r,u,c
(mythic rare,mythic,rare,uncommon,common)

art:squirrel,
query by what is listed in the card art

function:removal,
This works off of the oracle tag system used by scryfall.

You can query for specific usertags that people have tagged a card with.



NOTE:if you want to query for Enter the Battlefield Effects, use:

is:etb,
This is because of a misnomer goof on scryfalls part
so having a shortcut that is not included in the oracle tagging system

More info on the available tags here:           https://scryfall.com/docs/tagger-tags
